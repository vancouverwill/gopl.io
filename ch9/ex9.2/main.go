/*
The population count of a bitstring is the number of set bits (1-bits) in the string.
For instance, the population count of the number 23, which is represented in binary as 101112, is 4.
The population count is used in cryptography and error-correcting codes, among other topics in computer science;
some people use it as an interview question. The population count is also known as Hamming weight.
